[Training](../training/) will be offered on July 17-18 in the Western hemishpere, and July 19-20 in the Eastern hemisphere. All training will be live and online.  Some topics will only offered in one hemisphere or the other.  Registration will be on a per session basis.  Training will use online platforms and almost all topics will be hands-on.

The main meeting will be held July 19-21 in the West, and July 20-22 in the East.  The same presentations will be offered in both hemispheres. We are seeking ways to also have posters, demos, and birds-of-a-feather span both hemispheres.

The [CollaborationFest](../cofest/) will follow the meeting, and span the entire world (nothing new there).  There will be core communities during both windows, but we are also exploring other options for coordinating efforts continuously.
