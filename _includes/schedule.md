##### Training

Training is offered over two days: July 17-18 in the <a href='https://bcc2020.sched.com/overview/area/West%3A+Americas'>West</a>, and July 18-19 in the <a href='https://bcc2020.sched.com/overview/area/East%3A+Asia+%26+Australia'>East</a>. This is immediately before the BCC2020 meeting.

Training covers a variety of topics and is offered throughout both days, although some topics may be offered only in one hemisphere or another. All training will be live and online. Each session is 2.5 hours long. You register for each session individually.

Please see <a href='https://bcc2020.sched.com/overview/subject/Training'>BCC2020 Schedule Descriptions</a> for information about each training session.

##### Main Meeting

The main meeting will be held July 19-21 in the West, and July 20-22 in the East.  The same presentations will be offered in both hemispheres. We are seeking ways to also have posters, demos, and birds-of-a-feather span both hemispheres.

##### Collaboration Fest

The [CollaborationFest](../cofest/) will follow the meeting, and span the entire world (nothing new there).  There will be core communities during both windows, but we are also exploring other options for coordinating efforts continuously.
