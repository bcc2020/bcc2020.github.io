### Submissions

BCC2020 will be held in July, online, and on both sides of the world. This brings the 2020 Galaxy Community Conference and the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference together into a unified event. If you work in open source life science or data-intensive biomedical research, then there is no better place than BCC2020 to present your work and to learn from others.

**BCC2020 is seeking oral presentations, lightning talks, posters, and demos.**

**The deadline for submitting abstracts (for all types of presentation) is May 8.**

**The full call and guidelines for submitting are [available on the OBF website](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc/submit/).** (Those guidelines apply to Galaxy content as well.) Abstracts are submitted through EasyChair.
