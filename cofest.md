#### What is it?

BCC2020 will finish with an online CollaborationFest, a 2 (or 4) day collaborative work event where our community gathers virtually to contribute code, documentation, training materials, and challenging analysis problems and use cases. If you are interested in learning and contributing in an intensely collaborative environment, then CollaborationFest is for you.

#### Core and Encore

CoFest is split in half again this year:

* **CollaborationFest: Core:** Friday & Saturday</b>: There will be lots of collaborative work, but also lots of learning about projects and software. This will be the larger of the two stages. All you need to attend this is an interest and willingness to contribute.

* **CollaborationFest: Encore:** Sunday & Monday</b>: The smaller (and dare we say <i>more intense</i>) of the two stages, these two days will focus on collaboration, collaboration, collaboration.

#### Registration

CollaborationFest is free, for all 4 days. You still need to register (and select either 2 or 4 days).
