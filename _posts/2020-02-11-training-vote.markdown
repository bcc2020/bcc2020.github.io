**Vote for the Training Topics you want!**

Voting is now open on what training topics will be offered at BCC2020.

Your vote will determine the topics that are offered, which topics should be offered more than once, and which ones should not be scheduled at the same time. Your vote matters.

Topic voting closes February 21. The Training schedule, including instructors, will be published before early registration opens.

BCC2020 will be held 18-25 July in Toronto, right after ISMB 2020 in Montreal. It will feature a dedicated day of training: three days of mixed meeting and training, followed by 2 to 4 days of CollaborationFest.  Training will be hands-on and participants will be strongly encouraged to bring a laptop and follow along. If you work in data-intensive biomedical research, there is no better place than BCC2020 to present your work and to learn from others.

Thanks for your time and input, and we hope to see you in Toronto!
