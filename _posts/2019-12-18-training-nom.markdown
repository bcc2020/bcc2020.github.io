**The tutorials offered at BCC2020 are determined by you!**

The [Bioinformatics Community Conference, BCC2020](https://bcc2020.github.io/), will bring together the Galaxy Community Conference (GCC) and the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) in Toronto, Canada in July 2020.  

Please take a few minutes to consider which training topics you would like to see offered at BCC2020. Any topics of interest to these communities can be nominated. BCC2020 will offer parallel/multitrack training over several days.  Training sessions are 2 1/2 hours long.  You may nominate topics that span 1, 2, or 3 sessions.

Got ideas?  **[Nominate them by January 17](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSel0N-OY9XoOnCa5MU0Tlo1CIp0eSGrOVyxOXzVxwRGvmrxnQ/viewform).**  Nominations will then be compiled and voted on by the community.

Thanks for your time and input, and we hope to see you in Toronto!
