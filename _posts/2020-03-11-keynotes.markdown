[Lincoln Stein](https://oicr.on.ca/investigators/lincoln-stein/) focuses on supporting biomedical research both in Ontario and around the world by making large and complex biological datasets findable, accessible and usable.

Prior to joining [OICR](https://oicr.on.ca/) in 2006, Dr. Stein played an integral role in many large-scale data initiatives at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](https://www.cshl.edu/) and at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](http://www.mit.edu/) Genome Center. He led the development of the first physical clone map of the human genome, and ran the data coordinating centre and the data portal for the SNP Consortium and the HapMap Consortium. Lincoln has also led the creation and development of [Wormbase](https://wormbase.org/), a community model organism database for *C. elegans*, and [Reactome](https://reactome.org/), the largest open community database of biological reactions and pathways.

At OICR, Dr. Stein has led several international cancer data sharing and research initiatives, including the creation and development of the data coordination centre for the [International Cancer Genome Consortium](https://icgc.org/) and other related projects. 

Lincoln was also a keynote speaker at the very first BOSC in 2000.  We are looking forward to welcoming him back.
