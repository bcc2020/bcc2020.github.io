Toronto is about 2 hours from the American border near Niagara Falls and 4 hours from Detroit. Driving and parking in downtown Toronto can be challenging due to traffic and high parking prices. Check with your housing or accomodation to confirm parking places.

[Limited parking](https://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/hospitality-services/overnight-accommodation/parking/) is available near Victoria University for a daily fee.

##### Public Transit

Toronto has two transit operators: the [TTC](http://www.ttc.ca/index.jsp) for subways, busses, and streetcars within city limits, and [Go Transit](https://www.gotransit.com/en/) for regional busses and trains. Both services accept cash and reloadable [Presto Cards](https://www.prestocard.ca/en/). Victoria University is very close to the Musuem TTC subway stop.
